# Bubble Sort

Bubble sort is a sort algorithm that compares elements within an array and check if they are in order. If they are not, then they are switched and the loop goes on until the array is ordered.

## Time complexity

This algorithm has a time complexity of `O(n^2)`.
The larger the array, the more time it will take to order, that's why this algorithm is not indicated for large arrays.
